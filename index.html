            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <strong>California Native </strong>
            <P>I was born an raised out of the Central valley of California.  Living right in the middle of the state has its benefits. Being close to two of the most well known cities brings exposes you to alot of culture.  All of my friends have different ethnic backrounds than me.  I'm greatful that my hometown is such a melting pot of culture because it conditioned me to be open to different ideas other than my own.   </P>
